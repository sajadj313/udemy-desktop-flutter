# Udemy clone for desktop

Welcome to this repo ðŸŽ‰

Udemy is a great platform but it lacks support for desktop users. As an inspiration, I developed this sample clone version to demonstrate the capabilities of the newly blooming Flutter for desktop.

Take a look at what I have done so far and you are welcome to contribute to this as well.



## Setting up

1. Clone this project
2. Run `flutter config --enable-windows-desktop`
3. Open `Visual Studio Code`
4. Run the project


Thank you
