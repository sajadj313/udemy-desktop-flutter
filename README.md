# Udemy clone for desktop

Welcome to this repo ðŸŽ‰

Udemy is a great platform but it lacks support for desktop users. As an inspiration, I developed this sample clone version to demonstrate the capabilities of the newly blooming Flutter for desktop.

Take a look at what I have done so far and you are welcome to contribute to this as well.

Thank you
